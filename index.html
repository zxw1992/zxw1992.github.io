			<h2>About Me</h2>
			Xiwu Zhang is a Ph.D. student from <em>Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)</em>.<br>
			<br>
			He received his B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 2014, majoring in mechanical engineering and automation. 
			He is currently pursuing his Ph.D degree at School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China. During June, 2017 and June, 2018, 
			He was visiting the School of Computing and Information Technology, University of Wollongong, Australia. <br>
			<br>
			His main research interest includes <b> computer vision, deep learning and robotics.</b> 
			For computer vision and deep learning, he is interested in visual place recognition, image retrieval, deep learning-based image representations and deep convolutional neural networks for image processing and so on. 
			For robotics, he focuses on visual-based autonomous robots/vehicles, including visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), deep learning-based loop closure detection and perception with multiple imaging data (e.g., RGB-D images).
